# Note: to use find_packages, it must be run on upper level. Otherwise
# it will be run each time the package becomes imported. See setup.py

# List run-time dependencies here.  These will be installed by pip when
# your project is installed. For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's

#               By running $ tox, .tox will be recreated with correct deps.

# $ pip install -e .[dev,test]

# DEPRECATED: Use 'tox' with 'pyenv' instead.
